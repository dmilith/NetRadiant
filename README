This is fork of official Netradiant repository for OSX Snow Leopard/Lion and 64bit executable support.

1. Install XQuartz
2. install homebrew + gtk2 + deps
3. Download latest release (binary) of Netradiant for OSX (latest available 32bit build is on Netradiant site)
4. Fight with idiotic #error directives in glib. Do: make DEPENDENCIES_CHECK=off in this repository (don't expect pkg-config to work well..)
5. Take everything under install/, and copy it over same directory in previous release.
6. You're done, and You have 64bit version of Netradiant working.


Prebuilt 64bit version is available at: http://get.files.verknowsys.com/files/d0df25c85cef740557ee7be110d93fbdb7c899ad6h/1c600cb1b5d1fc486e2593ed2e6b106c225f9bf8
